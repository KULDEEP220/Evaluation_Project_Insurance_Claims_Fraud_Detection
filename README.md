# Evaluation_Project_Insurance_Claims_Fraud_Detection
Aim: Predicting if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not
Problem Statement:
Insurance fraud is a huge problem in the industry. It's difficult to identify fraud claims. Machine Learning is in a unique position to help the Auto Insurance industry with this problem.

In this project, you are provided a dataset which has the details of the insurance policy along with the customer details. It also has the details of the accident on the basis of which the claims have been made.

In this example, you will be working with some auto insurance data to demonstrate how you can create a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not.
